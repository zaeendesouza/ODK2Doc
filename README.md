# ODK2Doc üì±‚û°Ô∏èüìù 
This is a shiny app that converts xls survey forms (Used in Kobo, ODK & SUrveyCTO) to formatted word documents for printing and/or adding to reports. The final app is available for use [here](https://zaeendesouza.shinyapps.io/ODK2Doc/). I am still testing it out on various forms, but if you find any issues or errors, please flag these. Also, if you would like a specific feature(s) to be added, please let me know and I will try my best to add them.



**Note:** *This is the first version of this, and I do plan to add more features. The next version will have options for adding skip logic and other conditions to the form, too!*
